        Good Party is <strong>not a political party</strong>. We build tools to
        change the rules, and are mobilizing a movement of people to disrupt the
        corrupt two-party system.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our team is 100% remote, with diverse backgrounds and political beliefs.
        We work hard on our mission but care about each other, and our own well
        being too.
        <br />
        <br />
        If creatively disrupting politics for good sounds like a challenge
