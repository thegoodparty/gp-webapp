              (i) upon 7 day prior written notice, with or without cause; or
              (ii) immediately in the case of material breach by Customer,
              including Customer’s failure to timely pay Fees when due. For the
              avoidance of doubt, Good Party expressly reserves the right to
              terminate the applicable Services Agreement in the event that
              Customer utilizes the services for purposes that Good Party, in
              its sole discretion, deems objectionable.
